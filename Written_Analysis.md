# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of project
This project involved utilizing what we learned in Module 1 in Excel to help Louise analyze the data she had for kickstarters. The purpose was to take the dataset and organize the data in a way that we could present it to Louise in a clear and concise way. We specifically looked at:
* Outcomes based on launch date and
* Outcomes based on goal
We utilized the skills we learned in Module 1 including: pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting. It was a great way to conclude our chapter on Excel and put what we learned to the test! 

## Analysis and challenges
My analysis involved creating pivot tables to drill down to the specific type of parent category and subcategory of data that I wanted to present to Louise. Using pivot tables allowed me to organize the data in a way that it was easily presentable and interperatable. I also used charts to visualize the data. Using both the pivot tables and charts allows for the user to see the data in different ways. One challenge with both pivot tables and charts is deciding how to filter your data. When looking at the theater outcomes by launch date chart, this includes every year that had data about a theater launch. If the user is only interested in recent years or a specific time period, you would need to filter that data accordingly. It's important to understand what the user is trying to accomplish when organizing and presenting your data in both pivot tables and charts.
