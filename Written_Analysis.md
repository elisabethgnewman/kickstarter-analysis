# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of project
This project involved utilizing what we learned in Module 1 in Excel to help Louise analyze the data she had for kickstarters. The purpose was to take the dataset and organize the data in a way that we could present it to Louise in a clear and concise way. We specifically looked at:
* Outcomes based on launch date and
* Outcomes based on goal
We utilized the skills we learned in Module 1 including: pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting. It was a great way to conclude our chapter on Excel and put what we learned to the test!
